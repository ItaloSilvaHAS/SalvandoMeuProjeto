# SalvandoMeuProjeto

In this project, I gave life to an inner desire. 
I had an RPG called "Crossoverse" and to make it easier to access information, I wanted a site that talked about most of the things the RPG offered. 
While developing, a flash of ideas came into my head and I started milking these ideas to form something bigger. 
I ended up wanting to create a project where a website helps tabletop RPG masters, with features such as character creation, map, character ideas and developments, and the like.
